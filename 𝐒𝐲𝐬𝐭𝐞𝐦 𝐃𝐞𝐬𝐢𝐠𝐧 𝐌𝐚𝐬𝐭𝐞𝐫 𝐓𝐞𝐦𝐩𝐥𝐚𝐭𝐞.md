The System Design Master Template is a comprehensive resource that covers the key components of scalable and robust systems.

### These components include:

- 𝐃𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐍𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 (𝐃𝐍𝐒): It is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, which are used to locate and access web servers.

- 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫: This ensures that no single server is overloaded and that users can access the system even if one server fails.

- 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐰𝐚𝐲: It acts as a buffer between the client and the backend servers, providing a single point of control and visibility.

- 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐃𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐍𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤 (𝐂𝐃𝐍): It delivers content to users from the server that is closest to them, reducing latency and improving performance.

- 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲 𝐯𝐬. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐱𝐲: Both types of proxies can be used to improve security and performance.

- 𝐂𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠: Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval. This can improve the performance of a system significantly.

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: This can improve the efficiency of data storage and retrieval.

- 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: This can improve the performance and scalability of a database.

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: This can improve data availability and fault tolerance.

- 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐌𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬: This is essential for coordinating the activities of different components and ensuring that the system functions as a whole.

- 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬: This is essential for managing large volumes of data across multiple servers.

- 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦: This can be done through email, SMS, push notifications, or other means.

- 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥-𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡: Full-text search allows users to find information quickly and accurately by searching across the entire text of a document or database.

- 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞: It is typically used to support business intelligence and decision-making.

- 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬: This is essential for ensuring that the system functions correctly and reliably.

By understanding the key components of system design, you can build scalable and robust systems that can meet the needs of your users.
