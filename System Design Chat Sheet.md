# System Design Chat Sheet

System design is key to building scalable, reliable, and efficient applications. Let's look at a breakdown of essential concepts:

## 1. Fundamentals of System Design
Scalability, availability, and reliability ensure systems can handle growth and maintain performance. Latency, throughput, and the CAP theorem define system trade-offs.

## 2. Load Balancing
Techniques like round robin, least connections, and consistent hashing distribute traffic efficiently across servers to optimize performance.

## 3. Databases
SQL is structured and ACID-compliant, while NoSQL is flexible and scalable. Scaling strategies include vertical scaling, sharding, and replication.

## 4. Message Queues & Event-Driven Systems
Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Pub/Sub models enable asynchronous communication for high-throughput and real-time processing.

## 5. Caching Strategies
Write-through and write-back caching improve data access speed, while eviction policies like LRU, LFU, and FIFO manage cache efficiency.

## 6. API & Communication
REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSockets facilitate data exchange and real-time communication between distributed systems.
